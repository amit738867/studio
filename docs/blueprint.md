## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#ADD8E6) to establish a friendly and accessible aesthetic. The use of light blue throughout will associate EventEye certificates with approachability.
- Background color: White (#FFFFFF), providing a clean and unobtrusive background that complements the primary color without being distracting.
- Accent color: Light purple (#E6E6FA) to add visual interest and highlight interactive elements and CTAs.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern and readable interface.
- Use a set of consistent, minimalist icons from 'Lucide React' to represent various actions and data points. Follow a monoline style with a stroke width of 2 pixels in most cases.
- Emphasize a clean and structured layout with clear spacing and intuitive grouping of elements, ensuring easy navigation.
- Incorporate subtle transition animations for a smoother user experience when navigating between sections or loading data.
